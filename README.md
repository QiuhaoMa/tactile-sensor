# Tactile-sensor
This is the individual project of MRE 320.<br>
This project mainly introduces three tactile sensors they are Square FSR, Long Flex/Bend Sensor,and we will discusses their functions, applications and static characteristics. Among them, static characteristics is the most important part, so we set up a testing plan to obtain the required data.
## What is include in this project?
Report(Get familiar with tactile sensors and propose testing plan)<br>
Presentation slides<br>
Wiring Diagrams and pictures of actual experiment setup<br>
Arduino codes<br>
Measured data and analysis<br>
Summarized final results and diacussions<br>
